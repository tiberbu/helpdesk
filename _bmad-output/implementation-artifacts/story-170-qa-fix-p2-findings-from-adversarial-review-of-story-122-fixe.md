## Description

## QA Report Task — DO NOT MODIFY CODE

**Review task #164: Fix: P2 findings from adversarial review of Story #122 fixes**

### What to verify
Read the story file for acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/story-164-fix-p2-findings-from-adversarial-review-of-story-122-fixes.md`
Run Playwright browser tests to verify each acceptance criterion.

### Files changed

2. Navigate to the relevant pages
3. Test each acceptance criterion from the story file
4. Check for regressions in related functionality
5. Verify no console errors

### Deliverable
Produce `docs/qa-report-task-164.md` with:
- Each AC: PASS/FAIL with evidence
- Screenshots referenced (use task-prefixed naming)
- Console errors captured
- Severity ratings (P0-P3) for any failures
