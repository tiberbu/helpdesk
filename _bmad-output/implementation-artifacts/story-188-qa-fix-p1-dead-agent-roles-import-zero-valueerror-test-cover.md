## Description

## QA Report Task — DO NOT MODIFY CODE

**Review task #184: Fix: P1 dead AGENT_ROLES import + zero ValueError test coverage + story-169 audit trail fabrication**

### What to verify
Read the story file for acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/story-184-fix-p1-dead-agent-roles-import-zero-valueerror-test-coverage.md`
Run Playwright browser tests to verify each acceptance criterion.

### Files changed

2. Navigate to the relevant pages
3. Test each acceptance criterion from the story file
4. Check for regressions in related functionality
5. Verify no console errors

### Deliverable
Produce `docs/qa-report-task-184.md` with:
- Each AC: PASS/FAIL with evidence
- Screenshots referenced (use task-prefixed naming)
- Console errors captured
- Severity ratings (P0-P3) for any failures
