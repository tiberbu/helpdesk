## QA Report Task — DO NOT MODIFY CODE

**Review task #102: Fix: P1 time tracking issues from adversarial review (Story #95)**

### What to verify
Read the story file for acceptance criteria: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/story-102-fix-p1-time-tracking-issues-from-adversarial-review-story-95.md`
Run Playwright browser tests to verify each acceptance criterion.

### Deliverable
Produce `docs/qa-report-task-102.md` with:
